# blockly-mobile

This project was made for another android project called AddonMaker (currently no longer developed)!
It enables the use of the Google Blockly Framework inside a Webview.
This was possible previously but I encountered some problems using the full potential of the platform.

Issues have been fixed and custom prompts were implemented to make the use of blockly on mobile devices as easy as possible!

This set comes with basic and custom blockly blocks included!
