# blockly-mobile

This project was made for another android project called AddonMaker (currently no longer developed)!
It enables the use of the Google Blockly Framework inside a Webview.
This was possible previously but I encountered some problems using the full potential of the platform.

This set comes with basic and custom blockly blocks included!
